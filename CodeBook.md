# CodeBook
The raw data set have been downloaded from the specific URL highlighted in the description of the assessment.  
The data were processed using the run_analysis.R script and no other transformation was applied to it.  
The processing steps were the followings:  
* Read in the raw data and join the train and the test dataset together
* Make a data frame out of the mean and std values of the variables
* Join the data frames containing the information on the subjects and activity types
* Rename the variables appropriately
* Write out the first tidy data set to tidy1.txt
* Make a second tidy data set, containing aggregated data for each activity type and subject related to the observations
* Write out the second tidy data set to tidy2.txt  
  
  
# Dataset information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset. 

A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: [Web Link]

An updated version of this dataset can be found at [Web Link]. It includes labels of postural transitions between activities and also the full raw inertial signals instead of the ones pre-processed into windows.


Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.   
iqr(): Interquartile range  
entropy(): Signal entropy  
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4  
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals  
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude  
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal   
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal   
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.  
angle(): Angle between to vectors.  

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:  

gravityMean  
tBodyAccMean  
tBodyAccJerkMean

tBodyGyroJerkMean
